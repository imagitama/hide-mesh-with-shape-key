# Hide Mesh With Shape Key

A Blender plugin to join a mesh into another one and create a shape key to "hide" it (ie. shrink it to oblivion).

It also creates a vertex group for the original vertices so you can select it easily.

## Usage

Tested in Blender 3.1.2.

1. Add the plugin to Blender
2. Open the "Misc" tab
3. Select your base mesh (that will have the shape key)
4. Select your new mesh (that will be joined to the base mesh and hidden)
5. Click "Create"

Note that any armatures will need to be manually joined.
